# Backend Logs

This directory is used to store log files generated by the backend application. Logs are essential for monitoring, debugging, and maintaining the application.

## Log Types

1. **Error Logs**: Captures errors and exceptions that occur during runtime.
2. **Access Logs**: Tracks API requests, including endpoints accessed, response times, and user details.
3. **Debug Logs**: Provides detailed information for debugging purposes, including variable states and function calls.
4. **System Logs**: Records system-level events such as server start, shutdown, and resource usage.

## Log Format

- Logs are typically stored in a structured format (e.g., JSON) for easy parsing and analysis.
- Each log entry includes:
  - Timestamp
  - Log level (e.g., INFO, ERROR, DEBUG)
  - Message
  - Additional metadata (e.g., user ID, request ID)

## Log Rotation

To prevent excessive disk usage, logs are rotated periodically. Old logs are archived or deleted based on the configuration.

## Usage

- Ensure that the logging configuration in `src/utils/logger.ts` points to this directory.
- Use appropriate log levels to avoid cluttering logs with unnecessary information.
- Regularly monitor and analyze logs to identify issues and improve performance.

## Best Practices

- Avoid logging sensitive information such as passwords or personal data.
- Use unique identifiers (e.g., request IDs) to correlate logs across services.
- Implement alerts for critical errors to ensure timely resolution.
