# Web Logs Directory

This directory is designated for storing log files generated by the web application. Logs are essential for monitoring, debugging, and maintaining the health of the application.

## Types of Logs

1. **Error Logs**:
   - Captures application errors, stack traces, and unhandled exceptions.
   - Useful for identifying and resolving issues in the application.

2. **Access Logs**:
   - Records details about incoming requests, such as IP addresses, endpoints accessed, and response times.
   - Useful for monitoring traffic and identifying potential security threats.

3. **Debug Logs**:
   - Contains detailed information about the application's internal state during execution.
   - Useful for developers during the debugging process.

## Log Management

- **Retention**: Logs should be rotated and archived periodically to prevent excessive disk usage.
- **Security**: Ensure that sensitive information (e.g., user data, tokens) is not logged.
- **Monitoring**: Use tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or a cloud-based logging service for real-time monitoring and analysis.

## File Naming Convention

- Logs are named using the following format:
  ```
  <log-type>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.log
  ```
  Example: `error-2023-10-01.log`

## Best Practices

- Always sanitize user inputs before logging to avoid injection attacks.
- Use structured logging (e.g., JSON format) for easier parsing and analysis.
- Avoid logging sensitive information such as passwords or personal identifiable information (PII).

This directory is automatically ignored by version control systems (e.g., `.gitignore`) to prevent logs from being committed to the repository.
