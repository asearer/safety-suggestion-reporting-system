# Mobile Logs

This directory is designated for storing log files generated by the mobile application. Logs are essential for debugging, monitoring, and maintaining the health of the application.

## Types of Logs

1. **Error Logs**:
   - Captures application errors, crashes, and exceptions.
   - Useful for identifying and resolving critical issues.

2. **Debug Logs**:
   - Provides detailed information about the application's behavior during development.
   - Helps developers trace and debug issues.

3. **Performance Logs**:
   - Tracks metrics like app load time, API response time, and memory usage.
   - Useful for optimizing the app's performance.

## Log Management

- Logs should be rotated periodically to prevent excessive storage usage.
- Sensitive information (e.g., user data, authentication tokens) must never be logged.
- Use a consistent format (e.g., JSON or plain text) for all log entries.

## Tools and Libraries

Consider using a logging library like `winston` or `react-native-logs` to manage logs efficiently.

## Best Practices

- Always include timestamps in log entries.
- Use log levels (e.g., `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`) to categorize logs.
- Avoid logging in production unless necessary for monitoring or debugging.
